## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`get_owasp_rules.py` is now a real SecLang → caddy-waf translator** (was a regex scrape of `SecRule` lines that validated patterns with Python's `re`, ignored chains and `t:` chains, and could not read `@pmFromFile` keyword lists). It parses continuations, chained rules and quoted actions; ports `@rx` rules as-is and `@pm`/`@pmFromFile` lists as a case-insensitive alternation (sorted so Go's regexp factors the shared prefixes, which is 10–20× faster to match than an unsorted list); maps CRS variables onto targets (`ARGS` → `ARGS` + `BODY`, `REQUEST_HEADERS:Host` → `HOST`, `XML` → `BODY`, …) and `t:` chains onto the engine's `transformations` field; rewrites a leading `^`/trailing `$` on collection targets to a member boundary (ModSecurity matches each parameter value on its own; caddy-waf matches the raw query string); derives the score from the CRS severity and emits every rule as `log` so the output is advisory until `log_scores_block` is set; splits the output by paranoia level and by request/response phase; and applies a tuning file (`<id> remove`, `<id> remove-target BODY`, the caddy-waf equivalent of `SecRuleUpdateTargetById`). Every pattern is validated by `tools/re2check`, a small Go program that compiles it with the same `regexp` package the WAF uses, so a pattern RE2 rejects is skipped at generation time instead of failing to load. A generated `COVERAGE.md` lists every skipped rule with its reason (chained, non-regex operator, `^$` presence check, unsupported transformation, …) and every ported rule that lost a transformation, exclusion or anchor on the way. Unit tests in `test_get_owasp_rules.py` (run by CI). Documented in `docs/scripts.md`.

## [v0.4.14] - 2026-09-05

### Added
- `double-encoded-injection-chars` rule (`rules.json`, `rules-browser-friendly.json`): blocks double-encoded quote / angle-bracket / NUL (`%2527`, `%2522`, `%253C`, `%253E`, `%2500`). Deliberately excludes `%252F`, which legitimate nested-URL parameters carry; double-encoded traversal is caught by a new `..%252F` branch in `path-traversal` instead.
- `sql-injection-body` rule: high-confidence body-only SQLi (adjacent UNION SELECT, tautologies, timing functions, `xp_cmdshell`, `load_file`, `INTO OUTFILE`), split out of `sql-injection` so the main rule can tolerate prose in bodies without losing detection.
- Regression suites: `fp_browser_regression_test.go` (14 browser-shaped requests that each returned 403 before this change, plus pins that script-tag XSS, UNION SELECT, traversal, cloud-metadata SSRF, Java deserialization and header-borne SQLi still block), `rules_rewrite_test.go` (11 closed false negatives, 6 removed prose false positives) and `rules/bundle_fixes_test.go` (regex-level pins for every closed bundle bypass).

### Changed
- **`log`-action rules are observational by default and no longer block via score accumulation.** Previously every matched rule, including `action: "log"`, added its score to the single `TotalScore` that drives the block decision, so a handful of independent low-confidence `log` signals could sum past `anomaly_threshold` and return a `403` even though no rule intended to block (the v0.4.12 `idor-attacks` fix in #185 called out exactly this failure mode; on current `main`, 51 shipped `log` rules are scored at or above the default threshold of 5 and therefore blocked on their own on a single match — 4 in `rules.json`, the rest in the opt-in `rules/` bundles). A `log` rule's score now accumulates into a separate advisory tally (`WAFState.AdvisoryScore`) that is logged (`advisory_score` on the request-completion record) and reported but does not affect blocking. `block` rules are unchanged: they block on match, and their scores still feed `TotalScore`.
  - **Migration.** If a deployment relies on `log` rules adding up to a block (CRS-style pure anomaly scoring), add the new Caddyfile directive **`log_scores_block`** (JSON: `"log_scores_block": true`) to restore the previous accumulation. Otherwise no action is needed; requests that were only ever blocked by accumulated `log` scores will now pass and be recorded with a non-zero `advisory_score`. Anything you want blocked should carry `action: "block"`.
- **Rewrote the default rules that blocked ordinary traffic or missed textbook payloads** (`rules.json` and `rules-browser-friendly.json`, same change in both):
  - `sql-injection` allows content between keyword pairs but not a `&` (real `SELECT col1, col2 FROM t` is caught; `?select=name&from=2024` and "select an item from the list" are not), adds string tautologies (`' OR 'a'='b`), `OR true/false`, `waitfor delay` (the old pattern demanded a paren T-SQL never uses), `pg_sleep`, `load_file`, `INTO OUTFILE`. BODY moved to `sql-injection-body`.
  - `xss-attacks` replaces its fixed event-handler whitelist with a generic in-tag `on*=` match accepting `/` as a separator (`<svg/onload=…>`, `<details ontoggle=…>`, `<body onpointerdown=…>` are now caught); dialog/eval calls require no space before the paren so "please confirm (by clicking)" does not match; the `data:` / `style=` / HTML-entity / `%XX`-anything branches that matched ordinary traffic are gone.
  - `rce-commands-expanded` adds `rm`/`nc`/`ncat`/`env`/`awk`/`sed`/`dd`/`chmod`/`chown`/`mkfifo`, `%0a`/`%0d` separators and separator-anchored recon commands (`uname`/`whoami`/`hostname`/`systeminfo`); drops the HEADERS target (the joined Cookie header made `; id=` match).
  - `block-scanners` is word-bounded and deduplicated (bare `zap` blocked Zapier webhooks) and adds masscan/ffuf/dirsearch/feroxbuster/zaproxy.
  - `ssrf-attacks` drops HEADERS (a LAN Referer like `http://nas.local/` blocked intranet apps) and adds bracketed IPv6 and hex (`0x7f000001`) hosts; `ssrf-reserved-ip` no longer matches class E/broadcast, so `mask=255.255.255.0` passes.
  - `crlf-injection-headers` requires an encoded CRLF *pair* (a lone `%0a` appears in legitimately encoded Referer URLs), drops the raw `\r`/`\n` branches Go's server makes unreachable, and scores below the default threshold.
  - `path-traversal` is case-insensitive and adds a `..%252F` branch; `insecure-deserialization-java` drops the `\xac\xed` branch (Go regexp compiles `\xac` as U+00AC, never raw bytes) and matches hex in either case; `sensitive-files` drops the generic `(config|backup|…).(json|yaml|…)` branch that blocked `/config.json`.
  - `nosql-injection-attacks` → `nosql-operator-injection`: matches a quoted `"$op":` key or `[$op]` parameter form instead of the bare words (`count`, `find`, `db`) the old rule matched in any JSON body.
  - `log4shell-jndi` (in `rules.json`) replaces the removed `log4j-14/15/16`: catches `${…jndi…}`, `jndi:` schemes and the nested `${${lower:j}ndi…}` obfuscation without matching CI syntax like `${{ inputs.x }}`.
- **Fixed the `rules/` category bundles' bypasses, duplicates and remaining false positives:**
  - `xxe.json`: closed the single-quote (`SYSTEM 'file://…'`), parameter-entity (`<!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM …>`) and no-space-before-`[` bypasses; the DOCTYPE rule also catches external-DTD XXE and no longer matches `<!DOCTYPE html>`; dropped the pointless HEADERS target.
  - `xss.json`: tag/handler rules accept `/` as a separator, use a generic `on*=` match (catches `ontoggle`, `onpointerdown`) and require no space before `(` in `alert(`/`eval(` so "retrieval(cached)" no longer blocks.
  - `sql-injection.json`: `union(select…)` caught; boolean tautologies match double-quote context; `WAITFOR DELAY` (no paren) caught; blind injection matches `2=2`/`'a'='a'`/`true`; `sqli-function-injection` no longer blocks `user(id: 1)` GraphQL/ORM calls and drops below the threshold; `sqli-limit-injection` loses an unreachable alternation.
  - `ssti.json` (13 → 5): the byte-identical `{{…}}`, `{%…%}`, `${…}`, `<%…%>` duplicates are consolidated into `ssti-curly-expression`, `ssti-block-statement`, `ssti-dollar-brace`, `ssti-erb-ejs-tag` (a single `${…}` used to stack 21–28 points and block CI YAML), scored below the threshold.
  - `lfi.json`: `lfi-windows-sensitive-files` accepts either slash direction (it required forward slashes, so `c:\windows\win.ini` never matched); `lfi-apache-config` adds the RedHat layout; `lfi-common-sensitive-files` escapes a stray `.` in `grub.cfg`.
  - `rce.json`: fixed the `\b(?:;|…)` construct whose word boundary made `q=;rm` unmatchable; added single-pipe coverage and separator-anchored recon commands; dropped the HEADERS target; `rce-java-exec` rewritten to catch `Runtime.getRuntime().exec(`, `Runtime.exec(` and `ProcessBuilder(` (its old trailing `\s*\(` required a double paren and never matched).
  - `ssrf.json`: file/ftp/gopher rules catch the single-slash form (`file:/etc/passwd`) Java and curl accept.
  - `insecure-deserialization.json`: Java hex form case-insensitive; PHP rule catches `C:` custom-serializable and namespaced classes; YAML rule catches `!!python/object/apply:` anywhere; prototype-pollution rule closes the `"__proto__" :` spacing bypass.
  - `graphql.json`: introspection rule catches aliased/nested `__schema` and `__type(` probes.
  - `authentication.json`: `auth-jwt-algorithm-none` → `auth-jwt-alg-none`, matching the base64url encodings of an `alg:none` header as they appear on the wire (the plaintext `"alg":"none"` never occurs in an encoded token).

- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.4.14`.
### Removed
- **Rules that blocked or logged ordinary traffic, and duplicates.** From `rules.json` / `rules-browser-friendly.json`: `rfi-http-url` and `open-redirect-attempt` (any Referer/Origin header is a URL), `sql-injection-improved-basic` (`-{2,}` matched every multipart boundary), `unusual-paths` (blocked `/login`, `/admin`, `*.php`), `http-request-smuggling` (its live branch blocked `Content-Length: 0`; the Transfer-Encoding branches are unreachable behind Go's server), the Sec-Fetch scoring pair `browser-integrity-sec-fetch-mode-no-cors-document-log-score` + `…-site-cross-site-document-log-score` (3+2 = threshold on every cross-site subresource), `xss-improved-encoding` (duplicate of `xss-attacks` plus a `%XX`-anything branch), `allow-legit-browsers` (+1 on every browser request, no allow semantics), `sensitive-files-expanded` (subset of `sensitive-files`, double-scored every hit). From the bundles: `rce-11` (`(?i)| id` has an empty alternation and matched **every request** with `action: block`), `rce-common-commands` (`\bid\b` blocked every `?id=`), `rce-encoded-separators`, `rce-environment-variables` (`$\w+` matched `$5`), `rce-os-info-commands`, `rce-process-manipulation` (`?top=10`), `deserial-python-pickle` (`g` + any 4 bytes fired on nearly all traffic), `graphql-union-type-abuse` (matched the English word "on"), `hpp-array-syntax` (standard `filter[a]=1`), `lfi-absolute-paths` (every static path), `lfi-encoded-slash-bypass` (any `%2f`), `rfi-http-url`, `rfi-compressed-files` (`?file=report.zip`), `sqli-alternative-encodings` (any quote), `sqli-basic-keywords` ("delete from my list"), `sqli-database-specific-keywords`, `sqli-exec-commands` ("docker exec"), `sqli-hex-encoded-injection` (any `0x` literal), `sqli-mysql-specific-comments` (any `#` or `--`), `ssti-attacks` ("set a date"), `ssti-velocity-directive` (any two `#`), `xss-comment-bypass`, `xss-data-href`, `xss-encoded-html-entities` (`&#8217;`), `xss-expression-attribute`, `xss-style-attribute` (`?style=dark`), `xss-unescaped-quotes`, `xss-url-encoded` (any percent-encoded byte), `xss-base64-encode`/`-decode` and `xss-javascript-tags` (not XSS vectors), `xxe-internal-ip` (`10.` in every Windows User-Agent), `xxe-parameter-entity` (`%\w+;` in urlencoded bodies), `auth-basic-header-suspicious` (every Basic-auth request), `auth-weak-password-indicators` (describes responses), and the redundant traversal subsets `lfi-13`, `lfi-long-path-bypass`, `lfi-symlink-traversal`, `lfi-windows-path-traversal`. Remote-URL RFI was deliberately not re-added: blocking any external `http(s)://` in a parameter breaks OAuth redirects and webhooks.
- **Rules that could never fire.** Removed 37 rule entries (28 distinct rule IDs; the `rules.json` and `rules-browser-friendly.json` copies count twice) whose pattern is structurally unable to match the traffic they describe, so deleting them changes no blocking or logging outcome. In `rules.json` and `rules-browser-friendly.json`: every `^$` "missing header/token" rule (`auth-login-form-missing`, `csrf-missing-token-post`, the four `browser-integrity-sec-fetch-*-missing-*` rules), which can never match because a missing header or empty body makes the extractor skip the rule; `browser-integrity-sec-fetch-dest-not-document-ua-suspicious-log-score`, whose target `HEADERS:Sec-Fetch-Dest-Not` is not a header any client sends; and `jwt-tampering`, whose `^eyJ` anchor is defeated by the `Bearer ` / cookie-name prefix it is matched against. In the `rules/` bundles: `rce-9` and `log4j-14/15/16` (a mid-pattern `$` end-anchor), `xss-0/1/2` (`(1)` is a capture group, so `alert(1)` never matches), `sqli-5` (`* ` quantifies a space), `lfi-data-wrapper` and `rfi-data-uri` (require `data://`, which a data URI never has), `lfi-windows-cifs` (four backslashes where a UNC path has two), `ssti-freemarker-directive` (FreeMarker directives never end in `#>`), `sqli-xpath-injection` (demands `=` right after `//node[`), `graphql-batching` (needs a bare `{query`, which JSON never contains), `ssrf-protocol-whitelist` (`^https?://` anchored against `k=v` / `/path`), `ssrf-redirects` (`Location`/`Redirect` are response headers), `hpp-duplicate-parameters` (cannot consume the `&` between pairs), `auth-jwt-no-signature` (same anchor problem as `jwt-tampering`), `auth-no-cookies-set` (`Set-Cookie` is a response header), `auth-login-form-missing` (`^$`), and `sqli-null-byte` (the default transformation chain strips NUL before matching, and `net/http` rejects a raw NUL in headers or the URL). `dead_rules_test.go` pins each removed pattern against the payload its description advertises and the `^$` skip behaviour, so the deletions are verifiable.
- **Retired three `rules/` category bundles that provided no usable coverage.** None of these files is loaded by default; they were opt-in bundles.
  - `rules/smuggling.json` (6 rules). Go's `net/http` server strips `Transfer-Encoding` from `r.Header` and rejects conflicting `Content-Length`/`Transfer-Encoding` combinations and duplicate `Content-Length` before the WAF runs, so `hrs-cl-te-mismatch`, `hrs-multiple-content-length`, `hrs-chunked-encoding-without-terminator` and `hrs-te-with-non-compliant-chars` could never see what they looked for (two of them also required a `\n` in the joined HEADERS string, which never contains one). The two rules that could fire were false positives: `hrs-invalid-te` matched `gzip` anywhere (every `Accept-Encoding: gzip` request) and `hrs-content-length-zero` logged every legitimate `Content-Length: 0` POST/PUT.
  - `rules/csfr.json` (7 rules). `csrf-missing-referer`, `csrf-missing-token-args`, `csrf-missing-token-post` and `csrf-token-not-present-in-cookies` are `^$` presence checks, which this engine never evaluates (a missing target skips the rule). `csrf-token-name-patterns` and `csrf-double-submission-cookies` logged exactly the well-protected traffic (every form carrying a `csrf`/`nonce` token, every site using double-submit cookies), and `csrf-token-length-check` matched any 32+ character token. CSRF cannot be decided from one request by regex; it needs the application's server-side token check.
  - `rules/data-validation.json` (5 rules). `data-validation-invalid-email`, `-invalid-phone` and `-invalid-date` use `(?:…){0,}` / "any non-matching character somewhere" constructions that match every request; `data-validation-int-overflow` (`\d{15,}`) logged Snowflake IDs and nanosecond timestamps; `data-validation-long-string` logged every body over 5000 characters (minified JSON, base64 uploads) and is bypassed by one newline.
  - `docs/attacks.md` records the retirement for the smuggling and CSRF categories. Anyone who still wants the old patterns can copy them from the last release that shipped them.

### Fixed
- **The rule `action` field was never read.** `Rule.Action` was tagged `json:"mode"`, but every shipped rule file (and the documentation) keys it `"action"`, so `Action` unmarshalled to the empty string for every rule. In practice `action: "block"` never triggered an explicit block: all blocking happened only when accumulated scores crossed `anomaly_threshold`, and the `log`-vs-`block` distinction did not exist at runtime. The tag is now `json:"action"`, and `mode` is still accepted as an alias (with `action` winning when both are present) so rule files written against the earlier documentation, which named the key `mode`, keep working. `docs/rules.md` now documents `action` as the canonical key. Two consequences worth knowing when upgrading: (1) a `block` rule now blocks on its first match regardless of score, which matters if your `anomaly_threshold` is higher than a rule's score (no rule shipped in `rules.json` or the `rules/` bundles is scored below the Caddyfile default of 5, but the JSON-config fallback threshold is 20, and 23 `rules.json` block rules score below that); (2) the load-time validation that only accepts `block` or `log` is now effective, so a custom rule with any other `action` value fails to load instead of silently running as a score-only rule. `rule_action_test.go` pins both the unmarshalling and the runtime effect.

## [v0.4.13] - 2026-09-04

### Changed
- **Hot-path performance: ~82% fewer allocations per request** ([#115](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/issues/115), [#116](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/issues/116)). A benign request against the shipped `rules.json` went from **1790 → 331 allocations/op and 170KB → 47KB/op** (≈122µs → ≈80µs), with no behaviour change:
  - Value extraction uses a static switch instead of building a 16-closure map on every call ([#188](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/188)).
  - The rule loop no longer wraps the request in a per-rule context that nothing read back ([#189](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/189)).
  - The request counters are now `atomic.Int64`, so the per-request path takes no metrics lock ([#190](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/190)).
  - Extracted target values are cached within a phase instead of re-extracted per rule ([#191](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/191)).
  - `compressWhitespace` returns the input unchanged when nothing needs folding ([#192](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/192)).
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.4.13`.

## [v0.4.12] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- **Stopped two rules from blocking ordinary traffic** ([#185](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/issues/185), [PR #186](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/186)). In the shipped `rules.json`/`rules-browser-friendly.json`:
  - `idor-attacks` matched any common parameter name (`id=`, `user=`, `file=`, `download=`, …) and any `/<digits>/` path segment, and its `score: 7` made it block on its own despite `action: log`. It now matches only opaque object references (a UUID, or a 32/40-hex path segment) as a non-blocking low-score log signal — IDOR cannot be decided from the request alone.
  - `rce-commands-expanded` matched bare words (`cat`, `id`, `ls`, `curl`, `wget`, `python`, …), so `?cat=animals`, `?id=5` and `curl`/`wget`/`python` User-Agents were all blocked. It now requires an injection context: a command after a shell metacharacter (`;` `|` `` ` `` `$(`), a command reading a sensitive path, `curl`/`wget` fetching a URL, or a pipe to a shell.
  - Added `fp_regression_test.go` pinning that benign params/bodies/User-Agents pass and real command injection is still blocked.

### Changed
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.4.12`.
- Made the CI benchmark regression gate robust to shared-runner noise (warm-up before measuring, 2× threshold), so it no longer false-fails perf-neutral PRs ([#185](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/issues/185), [PR #186](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/186)).

## [v0.4.11] - 2026-09-04

### Security
- **Path traversal in the request body is now inspected** ([#112](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/183)). A new conservative `path-traversal-body` rule catches LFI delivered through a POST body (form fields, JSON) — a repeated `../` or a direct sensitive-file path (`etc/passwd`, `/proc/self/environ`, …) — while a single legitimate `../` in a body does not trip it. The previous `path-traversal` rule covered only the URI and headers.
- **Rule hot-reload is now fail-safe** ([#113](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/182)). A bad edit to a live rule file (invalid JSON, or no rules parsed) no longer wipes the in-memory rule set to empty; the reload fails and the previously loaded rules stay in effect.

### Added
- **`geoip_fail_open` Caddyfile directive** ([#113](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/182)). The knob that flips a failed GeoIP lookup from block (403, the secure default) to allow was previously reachable only through raw JSON.
- **Security posture docs** ([docs/security.md](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/docs/security.md)): ReDoS resistance ([#111](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/181)), the fail-safe behaviour matrix and secure defaults ([#113](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/182)), and evasion coverage ([#112](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/183)).
- **Security regression corpora**: a ReDoS corpus over every shipped rule ([#111](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/181)) and an evasion/bypass corpus through the live handler ([#112](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/183)).

### Fixed
- **Modular rule bundles audited** ([#172](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/179)): fixed invalid JSON (`lfi.json`, `rfi.json`), rewrote `data-validation`'s over-cap repeat, removed backreference rules (`hpp`, `sql-injection`), and removed the non-functional ModSecurity dump `rules/spiderlabs.json`. `TestBundledRulePatternsCompile` now compiles every `rules/*.json` bundle and rejects duplicate IDs. New `rules/README.md` documents the shipped set vs the opt-in bundle menu.

### Changed
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.4.11`.

## [v0.4.10] - 2026-09-03

### Changed
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.4.10`.

### Fixed
- **Modular rule-bundle audit** ([#172](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/179)). The opt-in `rules/*.json` bundles (pointed at with `rule_file`, not loaded by the default `rules.json`) are now all valid and RE2-compatible:
  - Fixed invalid JSON in `rules/lfi.json` and `rules/rfi.json` (single-backslash regex escapes JSON rejected).
  - Rewrote `data-validation`'s `^.{5000,}$` (over RE2's 1000 repeat cap) as concatenated `.{1000}` runs.
  - Removed backreference rules that never loaded under RE2 (`hpp-parameter-combining`, `sqli-quoted-injection`).
  - Removed `rules/spiderlabs.json` — a raw ModSecurity CRS export whose `@rx`/`@eq`/`@pmFromFile` operator syntax this engine does not interpret, so its rules never matched. Generate an RE2-compatible bundle with `get_spiderlabs_rules.py` instead.

### Added
- `TestBundledRulePatternsCompile` now compiles **every** `rules/*.json` bundle under RE2 and rejects duplicate IDs, so a broken bundle fails CI instead of shipping inert.
- `rules/README.md` documenting the shipped set vs. the opt-in bundle menu and the RE2 pattern constraints.

## [v0.4.9] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- **Native Prometheus endpoint** ([#118](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/176)). `prometheus_endpoint <path>` serves the WAF counters and a `caddywaf_request_duration_seconds` **latency histogram** in the Prometheus text exposition format — scrape it directly, no exporter. Latency is recorded lock-free on the hot path.
- **Live dashboard demo** on the docs site (caddy-waf.com/demo), plus the dashboard is now **modular** (structure/style/behaviour split) with an automatic light/dark theme.

### Changed
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.4.9`.
- **Supply-chain hardening** ([#117](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/174)): every GitHub Action is pinned to a commit SHA; container images carry SLSA provenance + SBOM attestations; release binaries get an SPDX SBOM asset and a build-provenance attestation.
- **Hot-path benchmarks + CI regression gate** ([#114](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/175)): per-request latency/alloc benchmarks now gate PRs against regressions.

### Fixed
- Removed the inert, RE2-incompatible `auth-session-cookie-not-http-only` rule ([#161](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/issues/161)); a broader modular-rules audit is tracked in #172.
- Updated the hagezi DNS blocklist URL to its new path (community, thanks @mcbloch — [#150](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/150)).

## [v0.4.8] - 2026-09-03

### Changed
- **Dashboard UI is now modular and decoupled.** The page is split into separate embedded files — `ui/index.html` (structure), `ui/dashboard.css` (presentation), `ui/dashboard.js` (behaviour, in decoupled config/store/view/api modules) — served beneath the dashboard path. The theme follows the viewer's system light/dark preference automatically, with an explicit override honoured. No behaviour change for operators; the directive and opt-in are unchanged. ([#170](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/170), [#143](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/issues/143))
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.4.8`.

### Fixed
- A `dashboard` path configured with a trailing slash now matches and serves its assets correctly.

## [v0.4.7] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- **Built-in dashboard (opt-in).** A read-only web dashboard rendering the metrics payload — requests allowed/blocked with client-derived rates, blocked-by-reason and per-phase breakdowns, top rules, top offending IPs, blocks by country, and a live tail of recent blocked requests. Served by the WAF itself, same-origin with `metrics_endpoint`; a single self-contained page with **no vendored libraries and no third-party runtime requests**. Off unless enabled at two levels: the `with_ui` build tag **and** the `dashboard <path>` directive. Read-only — it cannot mutate WAF state — and carries no auth of its own, so protect it with Caddy (see [docs/dashboard.md](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/docs/dashboard.md)). ([#168](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/168), [#143](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/issues/143))

### Changed
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.4.7`.
- Removed the old, unwired `ui/` (a page hardcoding `localhost:8080` plus ~1 MB of vendored chart.js and font-awesome).

## [v0.4.6] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- **Dashboard metrics backend (M1).** `/waf_metrics` gains a `schema_version` (2) and a set of **back-compatible** fields for the planned built-in dashboard ([#143](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/issues/143)): `recent` — a bounded ring (256) of the most recent **blocked** decisions (timestamp, log id, client IP, method, path, reason, rule id, status, score, country); `top_ips` — the top offending client IPs by block count (bounded); `by_country` — blocks per ISO country (wiring up the previously unused per-country counter); `blocked_by_reason`; `top_rules`; and `server_time_ms` + `uptime_seconds` so a client can derive rates by diffing snapshots. Recorded once per block under a single mutex; all sections are bounded. Every pre-existing metrics field is unchanged. See [docs/metrics.md](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/docs/metrics.md#dashboard-fields-schema-2).

### Changed
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.4.6`.

## [v0.4.5] - 2026-09-03

### Security
- **`trusted_proxies`: `X-Forwarded-For` is no longer trusted by default.** The GeoIP country/ASN checks previously honoured `X-Forwarded-For` unconditionally, so a client reaching the WAF directly could spoof it to move its apparent IP past those filters. Client-IP resolution now has a trust boundary: forwarding headers are honoured **only when the immediate peer is a configured trusted proxy**, otherwise the peer address is used and the header is ignored. ([#163](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/163), closes [#94](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/issues/94))

### Added
- **`trusted_proxies`** (bare IPs, CIDR ranges, or `private_ranges`) — the peers allowed to speak for their clients. When the peer is trusted, the real client is taken from **`client_ip_header`** (e.g. `CF-Connecting-IP`) if set, else by walking `X-Forwarded-For` right-to-left to the first non-trusted address (resolving a trusted proxy chain). The resolved client IP now feeds the **rate limiter** (so a CDN's edges no longer share one bucket), the **GeoIP country/ASN** filters and the **`REMOTE_IP`** rule target. The IP blacklist is unchanged (peer + all hops). See [Client IP & trusted proxies](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/docs/client-ip.md).

### Changed
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.4.5`.
- `REMOTE_IP` now yields a bare IP (no port), consistent with the resolved client IP.
- Removed the old `getClientIP` helper that trusted `X-Forwarded-For` unconditionally.

### Migration
This changes a default in the **secure** direction. **If you run behind a CDN or reverse proxy and rely on filtering by the real client's country/ASN — or on per-client rate limiting, or `REMOTE_IP` rules — set `trusted_proxies`** (and, for header-based CDNs like Cloudflare, `client_ip_header`). Without it, those controls now judge the proxy's address instead of the client's. Full guidance and a Cloudflare example: [docs/client-ip.md](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/docs/client-ip.md).

## [v0.4.4] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- **SSRF rules no longer block benign query strings.** `ssrf-internal-ip` and `ssrf-reserved-ip` matched bare prefixes (`10\.`, `0\.`, `224\.`, …), so any digit-dot substring tripped them — a legitimate `/socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=polling&…` request whose Engine.IO cache-buster or sid contained something like `0.1` or `10.` accrued SSRF score until it hit a 403 at `anomaly_threshold` 20. The patterns now require full private/reserved dotted-quad IPs with word boundaries, so benign values no longer match while real SSRF still does — internal ranges (RFC1918, loopback), `0.0.0.0`, link-local `169.254.0.0/16` (the cloud metadata IP), and multicast/reserved. `ssrf-attacks`' bare cloud-keyword alternative was likewise narrowed to the actual metadata hostname. Applied across `rules.json`, `rules-browser-friendly.json` and `rules/ssrf.json`. ([#160](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/160))

### Changed
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.4.4`.

## [v0.4.3] - 2026-09-02

### Added
- **`whitelist_file` — load whitelisted IPs from a file, hot-reloaded on change.** The counterpart to `ip_blacklist_file`: point it at a text file of IPs/CIDR ranges (one per line, `#` comments allowed) exempt from the IP-reputation checks, so a job that refreshes the list (a cloud provider's published ranges, a partner's egress IPs, country-blocking exceptions) takes effect without a restart. Inline `whitelist_ip` entries and the file feed the same trie; the file need not exist at startup and is picked up when it appears. ([#158](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/158), closes [#151](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/issues/151))

### Changed
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.4.3`.
- The file watcher now follows the parent directory even when the watched file does not yet exist (so a later-created blocklist/whitelist file is picked up on creation), and selects ReloadRules vs ReloadConfig by rule-file identity rather than a path substring.

## [v0.4.2] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- **Every `POST` carrying a body no longer fails with a 502.** The WAF drained the request body during rule inspection and the upstream received an empty body while `Content-Length` kept its value, so `reverse_proxy` reported `ContentLength=N with Body length 0` and broke the connection. Rule extraction runs against per-rule request copies (`handlePhase` clones the request to tag the rule id), so restoring the body there never reached the request handed to the upstream. The body is now buffered once, up front, on the request that flows downstream and read from context during extraction; bodies within the inspection limit are re-readable with `GetBody` set, and larger bodies are forwarded whole (no upload truncation). ([#156](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/156))
- **Hot-reload now follows atomic file updates.** The file watcher watched the file inode and reacted only to `Write`, so an atomic update (write temp + `os.Rename` over the target — the standard blocklist/rule refresh) replaced the inode and left the watch permanently deaf. It now watches the parent directory, filters by basename, and reloads on `Create`/`Rename`/`Write`. ([#155](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/155))
- **Data race in the IP blacklist check.** `isIPBlacklisted` probed `m.ipBlacklist` outside the read lock, racing `ReloadConfig`'s locked swap (which hot reload performs). The redundant unsynchronised probe was removed; `go test -race ./...` is clean. ([#155](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/155))

### Changed
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.4.2`.
- Dependency bumps already on `main`: `stretchr/testify` 1.12.1, `google.golang.org/grpc` 1.83.1, and the Docker builder image to Go 1.27-alpine.

## [v0.4.1] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed
- **A response-target rule in an early phase no longer panics the request.** A rule listing `RESPONSE_HEADERS` (or `RESPONSE_HEADERS:<name>`) in phase 1 or 2 — as several OWASP CRS rules do, e.g. `950010` — reached `w.Header()` on the nil `http.ResponseWriter` that `handlePhase` passes before the response exists. The panic was recovered into an HTTP 500, so **every** request behind the WAF failed. Response-header extraction is now nil-safe (mirroring the existing response-body guard): an out-of-phase response target degrades to a skipped target instead of crashing. Reported on OPNsense with OWASP rules ([#144](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/issues/144), [#146](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/146)).

### Changed
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.4.1`.

### Internal
- `TestTorConfig_Provision` is now hermetic — it serves the Tor exit-node list from a local `httptest.Server` instead of a live external CDN, removing the last third-party network dependency from CI ([#147](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/147)).

## [v0.4.0] - 2026-08-18

### Security
**Rule matching now inspects requests the way the application will decode them, closing encoding evasion.** Confirmed empirically before the fix: a percent-encoded attack in a raw request target slipped past literal rule patterns. `rules/sql-injection.json` blocked `id=1 UNION SELECT` but **not** `id=1 %55NION%20SELECT`, nor `%75nion`, nor the same payload in an `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` body. Because the application decodes the request before acting on it, the WAF must match the decoded form. This affected the raw targets `ARGS`, `URI`, `URL` and `BODY` — the targets used by the bulk of the bundled and modular rules (SQLi, XSS, RCE, SSTI, SSRF).

The fix is **additive dual-match**: each target is matched against the raw value first, then against a normalized copy, and the rule fires if either matches. Testing the raw value first is a mathematical guarantee that no rule which matches today can stop matching — the change only adds coverage, never removes it. Unencoded traffic runs no extra regex (the normalized pass is skipped when normalization does not change the value).

Design followed ModSecurity/OWASP-CRS/Coraza prior art, including its guardrails:

- **Single-pass decoding**, never recursive. `%2555` decodes to the literal `%55`, matching what a single-decoding backend sees; decoding twice would manufacture false positives and diverge from reality.
- **Context-aware `+`**: a space in query/body context, literal in the path portion of `URI`/`URL`, which are split on the first `?`.
- **Lenient decoder**: a malformed escape (`%`, `%zz`, a truncated `%a`) is left literal, never dropped — Go's `url.QueryUnescape` blanks the whole value on one bad byte, which would itself be a bypass.

### Added
- **Optional per-rule `transformations` field** (ModSecurity/CRS-style pipeline): `["urlDecodeUni","removeNulls","replaceComments","htmlEntityDecode",…]`. Absent means the per-target default chain (`urlDecode`, `removeNulls`, `compressWhitespace`); an explicit `[]` means match the raw value only. Names are case-insensitive, accept a `t:` prefix, and an unknown name **fails at load time** rather than silently doing nothing.
- **ModSecurity/CRS target aliases** so SecLang-derived rule files resolve: `REQUEST_HEADERS`→`HEADERS`, `REQUEST_COOKIES`→`COOKIES`, `QUERY_STRING`→`ARGS`, `REQUEST_URI`→`URI`, `REQUEST_BODY`→`BODY`, `REQUEST_FILENAME`→`PATH`. Previously these fell through to "unknown extraction target" and were skipped, so 135 bundled rules (88 using `REQUEST_COOKIES`, 47 `REQUEST_HEADERS`) silently lost cookie/header coverage and one rule was fully inert.
- `transform.go` with the transformation registry and lenient single-pass decoders; `normalization_test.go` and `transform_test.go` covering the closed evasions, the zero-regression property, per-rule transformations, the aliases, load-time validation, and — as an explicit test — the documented limit that double-encoding is not decoded twice.

### Honest limits
Single-pass decoding does not catch double-encoding (correct against a single-decoding backend), and `%uXXXX` / overlong-UTF-8 are not decoded by the default pipeline. Cookie and header targets are not normalized by default; a rule that needs it can set `transformations`. See [Input normalization](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/docs/rules.md#input-normalization).

### Migration
This changes what every rule targeting `ARGS`/`URI`/`URL`/`BODY` sees. Because matching is additive (raw tested first), **no existing rule stops firing** and no config change is required. Rule authors who want the raw, un-normalized value only can set `"transformations": []` on a rule. Custom rule files using ModSecurity target names now gain coverage they were silently missing.

### Changed
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.4.0`.

## [v0.3.11] - 2026-08-18

### Added
- **`whitelist_ip` — exempt addresses from the IP-reputation checks without switching the WAF off for them.** Accepts bare IPs, CIDR ranges, or the token `private_ranges`, and is repeatable:

  ```caddyfile
  whitelist_ip private_ranges
  whitelist_ip 203.0.113.4 198.51.100.0/24
  ```

  Requested in [#137](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/issues/137) by [@nozonyan](https://github.com/nozonyan): `whitelist_countries` blocks anything it cannot geolocate, which includes every address on the local network, so enabling it locks you out of your own service from inside the LAN. The only workarounds were `geoip_fail_open` — which also admits every unresolvable *public* address — or maintaining two site blocks with separate rule sets, with the risk of leaving the public one unprotected after a test.

  The exemption covers the checks that judge a client by where it comes from: the **IP blacklist** (including Tor exit nodes fed into it), **`whitelist_countries` / `block_countries`**, and **`block_asns`**. It deliberately does **not** cover the DNS blacklist (which judges the requested host, not the client), the rate limiter, or the regex rules in any phase. Exempting an address from geolocation is the fix; stopping inspection of its requests is not.

  `private_ranges` expands to exactly the set Caddy uses for its own placeholder — `192.168.0.0/16`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `127.0.0.1/8`, `fd00::/8`, `::1`. Identical rather than "improved": a WAF and the server in front of it disagreeing about which addresses are private is how bypasses get built. An entry that does not parse fails startup rather than being skipped with a warning.

### Security notes on the design
- **The whitelist matches the peer address only, never `X-Forwarded-For`.** This is the deliberate opposite of the blacklist, which checks the peer address *and* every forwarded hop. When blocking, consulting extra addresses can only block more; when allowing, honouring a client-supplied header would let anyone send `X-Forwarded-For: 10.0.0.1` and exempt themselves from the blacklist, the country filter and the ASN filter in a single header. Covered by `TestWhitelistIgnoresForwardedHeaders`.
- **`private_ranges` is only safe when caddy-waf is the edge.** Because the check is on the peer address, running behind another proxy makes the peer that proxy — typically a private or loopback address — which would exempt every request passing through it. The WAF now logs a warning at startup when `private_ranges` is whitelisted, and `docs/configuration.md` documents the trap.

### Changed
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.3.11`.

## [v0.3.10] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed
- **`docker build .` ignored your source tree.** The Dockerfile ran `git clone https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf.git` and built that, so the build context was never used: the image contained whatever happened to be on `main` at build time, could not be pinned to a version, and a CI image build would have tested the wrong code. The build context is now the source.
- **The builder image was older than `go.mod` requires.** `golang:1.24-alpine` against a module declaring `go 1.25.1`; it only worked because `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto` silently downloaded a newer toolchain mid-build. Now `golang:1.26-alpine`.

### Added
- **Published container images at `ghcr.io/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf`**, built on release tags for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. Tagged by version as well as `latest`, so a deployment can pin — `latest` alone would leave anyone who pulled before a security release with no way to name the image they wanted.
- **`.github/workflows/docker.yml`** builds the image on pull requests without pushing, and asserts `caddy list-modules` reports `http.handlers.waf` rather than trusting a green build. Nothing built this image before, which is how it came to clone the repository instead of using the context, and to pin a stale Go version.
- `.dockerignore` extended so the context excludes `node_modules`, `docs/`, tests and helper scripts. `ui/` is deliberately kept: `assets.go` embeds it behind the `with_ui` build tag.

### Changed
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.3.10`.

## [v0.3.9] - 2026-07-28

### Security
Two further defects in the same subsystem, one of them the sibling of a bug fixed in v0.3.7. Both were surfaced by an adversarial sweep that drives real requests through `ServeHTTP` and asks whether the client is actually refused, rather than whether a helper returns `true`.

- **`ReloadRules` had the identical self-deadlock fixed in `ReloadConfig`.** It took `m.mu` and then called `loadRules`, which takes `m.mu` again; the goroutine blocked forever while owning the write lock, so every later request stalled on the `RLock` in the request path. This is the *primary* hot-reload branch: `startFileWatcher` routes any changed path containing `"rule"` to `ReloadRules`, which means editing `rules.json` — the case `docs/dynamicupdates.md` documents — wedged the server. v0.3.7 fixed one branch of the watcher and missed the other. Found by the automated review on [#130](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/130).

- **The DNS blacklist was bypassable, and inert on non-default ports.** `isDNSBlacklisted` only lowercased and trimmed the `Host` header, so `evil.example:8080` and `evil.example.` both missed an entry for `evil.example`. `r.Host` carries the port whenever the site is served on anything other than 80/443 — which every example in this repository does — so those deployments had no DNS filtering at all; and a client may send an explicit `:443` even on the default port, making it a one-header bypass. Hosts are now normalised (lowercase, port stripped, trailing dot removed, IPv6 brackets removed).

### Fixed
- **Data race on the IP blacklist during hot reload.** `ReloadConfig` swapped `m.ipBlacklist` under `m.mu`, but `isIPBlacklisted` read it without taking the lock, so the swap never synchronised with in-flight requests. The read is now under `RLock`, mirroring `isDNSBlacklisted`. Found by the automated review on [#130](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/pull/130).
- Documentation described the pre-v0.3.8 `X-Forwarded-For` behaviour ("first XFF value if present, otherwise `r.RemoteAddr`"), which stopped being true when that bypass was closed.

### Added
- `TestReloadRulesDoesNotDeadlock` — the branch v0.3.7 missed, asserted on a deadline and followed by a reader that must get through.
- The full suite now passes under `-race`.

### Changed
- Documented Go requirement corrected to **1.25.1**. `go.mod` declares it because `caddy/v2 v2.11.4` and `go.step.sm/crypto` require it and Go propagates the maximum; forcing `1.25.0` breaks the build.
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.3.9`.

## [v0.3.8] - 2026-07-28

### Security
**A single request header bypassed the IP blacklist entirely.** Phase 1 consulted `X-Forwarded-For` *instead of* `r.RemoteAddr` whenever the header was present:

```go
if xForwardedFor != "" {
    if m.isIPBlacklisted(firstIP) { block }
    // no else -- r.RemoteAddr was never checked
} else {
    if m.isIPBlacklisted(r.RemoteAddr) { block }
}
```

Any blacklisted client could send `X-Forwarded-For: 8.8.8.8` and skip the check. No tooling, no preconditions, no authentication — one arbitrary header. Demonstrated end to end: the same client is refused with `403` without the header and served `200` with it.

The peer address is now checked **first and unconditionally**, since it is the only value a client cannot forge, and the forwarded chain is checked **in addition** rather than instead. Checking more addresses can only block more, never less. A client can therefore blacklist itself by forging a listed address, which is harmless. Deciding which forwarded values to *trust* requires a `trusted_proxies` option and is tracked in [#94](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/issues/94).

This was masked until v0.3.7: before that the blacklist was never populated at all (see v0.3.7), so nothing was bypassable because nothing was enforced. Fixing enforcement made this the live bypass, which is why it ships one release later.

Covered by `GHSA-w6gv-76q4-prqg`, updated to reflect **v0.3.8** as the patched version.

### Added
- `TestBlacklistedIPIsBlockedEndToEnd/a_forged_X-Forwarded-For_cannot_skip_the_check` — a blacklisted peer sending a clean `X-Forwarded-For` must still be refused.

### Changed
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.3.8`.

## [v0.3.7] - 2026-07-28

### Security
Two defects in the blacklist subsystem, both silent. Reported in substance by [@doogienz](https://github.com/doogienz) in discussion [#96](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/discussions/96) on 2026-05-21, with the log evidence that pinned it down.

- **The IP blacklist never blocked anything.** `loadIPBlacklist` took the trie by value, and both callers — `Provision` and `ReloadConfig` — dereferenced their pointer to satisfy that signature. Every `Insert` therefore landed in a copy discarded on return: the trie the middleware consults stayed empty, while the loader still logged `IP blacklist loaded {"valid_entries": N}`. Any deployment relying on `ip_blacklist_file`, including the 223,770-entry list bundled with the project, had no IP filtering at all and no indication of it. Present since **v0.0.7** (commit `c905277`, "switch to go-trie", 2025-10-10) — 15 releases.

- **Hot-reloading a blacklist deadlocked the server.** `ReloadConfig` held `m.mu` and then called `loadRules`, which takes `m.mu` again; on Go's non-reentrant `RWMutex` the goroutine blocked forever *while still owning the write lock*. Since `isDNSBlacklisted` takes `m.mu.RLock()` on every request, all subsequent requests blocked forever — no crash, no log line. The file watcher calls `ReloadConfig` whenever `ip_blacklist_file` or `dns_blacklist_file` changes, and the documented Tor setup (`docs/dynamicupdates.md`) points `ip_blacklist_file` at the file the Tor fetcher rewrites every `update_interval` (default 24h), so the configuration the docs recommend wedges the server within a day of starting, unattended.

Both are fixed: the trie is passed by pointer, and `ReloadConfig` builds the new structures outside the lock, swaps them under it, and never holds `m.mu` across a call that takes it again.

### Added
- `blacklist_enforcement_test.go` — four regression tests: the trie is actually populated (IPv4, IPv6, CIDR, with and without a port), the reload path repopulates it, `ReloadConfig` completes and releases the lock under a deadline, and a full `ServeHTTP` pass confirms a blacklisted client is refused, never reaches the upstream, and that `X-Forwarded-For` is honoured.

### Changed
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.3.7`.

## [v0.3.6] - 2026-07-28

### Security
Cleared the Dependabot backlog on the default branch: **25 of 30 open alerts — 7 critical, 5 high, 13 moderate**. Every bump was verified by building and testing, not by trusting the suggestion.

| Module | From | To | Alerts closed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `golang.org/x/crypto` | v0.49.0 | **v0.52.0** | 7 critical, 2 high, 4 moderate |
| `github.com/caddyserver/caddy/v2` | v2.11.2 | **v2.11.4** | 2 high, 3 moderate |
| `google.golang.org/grpc` | v1.79.3 | **v1.82.1** | 1 high |
| `golang.org/x/net` | v0.52.0 | **v0.55.0** | 1 moderate |
| `github.com/quic-go/quic-go` | v0.59.0 | **v0.59.1** | 1 moderate |
| `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlpmetric/otlpmetrichttp` | v1.43.0 | **v1.44.0** | 1 moderate |
| `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlplog/otlploghttp` | v0.19.0 | **v0.20.0** | 1 moderate |

No source changes were required. `go build`, `go vet` and the full unit suite pass, and `xcaddy build` against the bumped tree produces a working Caddy **v2.11.4** binary that registers `http.handlers.waf`.

### Not fixed, and why

Five alerts remain open. Leaving them undocumented would be worse than leaving them open.

- **`github.com/google/cel-go` (moderate, GHSA-gcjh-h69q-9w9g)** — the suggested v0.29.0 **does not compile against Caddy v2.11.4**: `interpreter.NewCall` changed from `[]interpreter.Interpretable` to `[]interpreter.InterpretableV2`, and `caddyhttp/celmatcher.go` still passes the former. Caddy's own `go.mod` pins v0.28.1. Taking the bump would trade a moderate transitive advisory for a build that does not exist. Blocked until Caddy updates.
- **`vite` ×3 (1 high, 2 moderate) and `esbuild` ×1 (moderate)** — introduced in v0.3.5 by the `package-lock.json` for the VitePress docs site. All four are **development-server** issues (arbitrary origins reading dev-server responses; `server.fs.deny` bypass on Windows; NTLMv2 disclosure via UNC paths on Windows; path traversal in optimized-deps `.map` handling). CI only ever runs `vitepress build`, the published site is static HTML, and `npm audit --omit=dev` reports zero. The fix requires vite ≥ 6.4.3, which no stable VitePress pulls — `latest` is 1.6.4 and pins vite ^5.4.14; only the 2.0.0-alpha line moves to vite 6. Running an alpha documentation generator to silence dev-only advisories is the worse trade.

### Changed
- Documentation references to the pinned Caddy version updated from v2.11.2 to v2.11.4.
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.3.6`.

## [v0.3.5] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed
- **Caddy package registry could not scan this module.** `caddy.RegisterModule(&Middleware{})` parses as an `ast.UnaryExpr` wrapping the literal, and the static analyzer behind <https://caddyserver.com/account/register-package> accepts only a composite literal or `new()`. Every registration attempt therefore failed with the opaque portal error `unable to scan modules in package github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf`, which never names the offending line — leaving the module absent from <https://caddyserver.com/download> and `caddy add-package github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf` returning HTTP 400. Both `caddy.RegisterModule` and `ModuleInfo.New` now use `new(Middleware)`.

  The two forms are semantically identical (each allocates a zeroed `Middleware` and yields a pointer), so there is no behavioural change. The pointer is required regardless: `CaddyModule` has a pointer receiver and `Middleware` carries mutexes that must not be copied.

  Diagnosis courtesy of the Caddy community thread [Unable to register module in the portal](https://caddy.community/t/unable-to-register-module-in-the-portal/33572), where the underlying analyzer error is quoted as `unexpected argument to RegisterModule(): &ast.UnaryExpr{...} - expect either composite literal or new()`.

### Added
- `TestRegisterModuleArgumentIsScannable` — parses the package's own AST and asserts the `caddy.RegisterModule` argument stays a composite literal or `new()`, so the registry constraint cannot silently regress on a future edit. Verified to fail against the v0.3.4 pattern and pass against the fix.

### Changed
- Rewrote `CADDY_MODULE_REGISTRATION.md`, which was stale (referenced v0.0.6 and Caddy v2.9.1) and speculated that the failures were server-side and "may resolve automatically". It now records the verified root cause and the maintenance notes.
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.3.5`.

### Registered
With the scan fixed, `github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf` was claimed in Caddy's package registry on 2026-07-28 at 10:05:52 UTC, at `v0.3.5`. The build service now serves it (`GET /api/download?p=github.com%2Ffabriziosalmi%2Fcaddy-waf` returns a binary instead of HTTP 400), so `caddy add-package github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf` works and the module is selectable on <https://caddyserver.com/download>. `README.md`, `docs/installation.md` and `docs/add-package-guide.md` updated accordingly — they previously documented the install path as unavailable.

Note the module documentation shown on caddyserver.com is extracted from the doc comment on the `Middleware` struct in `types.go`.

## [v0.3.4] - 2026-07-28

### Security
- **Fixed unbounded response buffering (GHSA-gfj3-cmff-q8wh, CWE-400, CVSS 3.1 7.5 high, remote unauthenticated DoS).** Up to and including v0.3.3, `responseRecorder` accumulated the *entire* upstream response body in an in-memory `bytes.Buffer` before releasing a single byte to the client, with no configurable or hard-coded ceiling. A single unauthenticated request for a large or streaming resource made the Caddy process's heap grow in step with the response size, so an attacker could OOM-kill the process and take down every site served by that instance. Reported by [@EQSTLab](https://github.com/EQSTLab).

  The response body is now buffered only when it can actually be used, and only up to a bound:

  - **No Phase 4 rules ⇒ no buffering.** `ServeHTTP` now asks `hasResponseBodyRules()` before capturing anything; with no `RESPONSE_BODY` rule loaded the recorder is a pass-through that forwards writes as they arrive. The bundled `rules.json` has no Phase 4 rules, so the default configuration buffers nothing at all and no longer defeats HTTP streaming.
  - **Hard ceiling of `max_response_body_size`** (new setting, default 10 MiB). When a response outgrows the budget, the recorder writes out what it holds and streams the remainder straight to the client, so peak memory is bounded by the limit rather than by the response size.
  - **An upstream flush releases the buffer** instead of stalling, so server-sent events and chunked streaming work through a WAF-protected route rather than being held until the budget fills.
  - A released response cannot be blocked, since part of it is already on the wire. Phase 4 is skipped in that case and logged at `warn` (`"Response body exceeded the WAF inspection limit; Phase 4 rules were not applied"`) rather than scoring a truncated body and reporting the response as vetted.

  Measured on a 512 MiB response through a WAF-protected route: heap allocated during `ServeHTTP` drops from **1535 MiB to 0 MiB**, with all 512 MiB still delivered to the client.

### Added
- `max_response_body_size` (Caddyfile directive and JSON field, default `10485760`) — ceiling on how much of the response body is retained for Phase 4 inspection. Validated as non-negative by `Validate`; `0` selects the default.
- `max_request_body_size` is now settable from the Caddyfile as well, not only from JSON.
- `responseRecorder` implements `http.Flusher`.

### Fixed
- A Phase 4 block no longer swallows the configured `custom_response` body. `ServeHTTP` wrote the custom response into the recorder, whose buffer is discarded on the blocked path, so the client received an empty body; it now writes to the real `ResponseWriter`.

### Known limitation
- The status code of a Phase 3/4 block is still not applied: `responseRecorder.WriteHeader` forwards the status to the underlying `ResponseWriter` as soon as the upstream sets it, so by the time the response phases run the status line is already committed and a block surfaces as `200` with the custom body. This is pre-existing behaviour, unrelated to the advisory above, and is tracked separately.

### Changed
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.3.4`.

## [v0.3.2] - 2026-04-26

### Security
Patched 3 critical and 10 high severity Dependabot alerts by upgrading the affected dependencies to their fixed versions:

- `github.com/caddyserver/caddy/v2` v2.10.2 → v2.11.2 — fixes 4 high (FastCGI split_path Unicode case-folding bypass, MatchHost case-sensitivity bypass on >100 hosts, MatchPath %xx case normalization bypass, mTLS silent fail-open on missing CA file) and 2 medium (admin API CSRF on `/load`, file matcher glob sanitization).
- `google.golang.org/grpc` v1.78.0 → v1.79.3 — fixes 1 critical (authorization bypass via missing leading slash in `:path`).
- `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5` v5.8.0 → v5.9.2 — fixes 1 critical (memory-safety) and 1 low (SQL injection via dollar-quoted placeholder confusion).
- `github.com/smallstep/certificates` v0.29.0 → v0.30.2 — fixes 1 critical (unauthenticated certificate issuance via SCEP `UpdateReq` MessageType=18) and 1 low (TPM EKU validation index-out-of-bounds panic).
- `go.opentelemetry.io/otel` v1.39.0 → v1.43.0 — fixes 1 high (multi-value `baggage` header DoS amplification).
- `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk` v1.39.0 → v1.43.0 — fixes 2 high (BSD `kenv` PATH hijacking; arbitrary code execution via PATH hijacking).
- `github.com/go-jose/go-jose/v4` v4.1.3 → v4.1.4 — fixes 1 high (JWE decryption panic).
- `github.com/go-jose/go-jose/v3` v3.0.4 → v3.0.5 — fixes 1 high (JWE decryption panic).
- `github.com/slackhq/nebula` v1.9.7 → v1.10.3 — fixes 1 high (blocklist bypass via ECDSA signature malleability).
- `github.com/cloudflare/circl` upgraded to v1.6.3 — fixes 1 low (incorrect `secp384r1` `CombinedMult` calculation).
- `filippo.io/edwards25519` upgraded to v1.2.0 — fixes 1 low (`MultiScalarMult` invalid results when receiver is not the identity).

No source-code changes required; the WAF compiles and the full unit test suite passes against the upgraded dependency tree.

### Changed
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.3.2`.

## [v0.3.1] - 2026-04-26

### Documentation
- Rewrote `README.md`, `MODULE.md`, `caddyfile.example`, and the entire `docs/` tree to be 1:1 accurate with the current source code.
- `docs/configuration.md` now lists every Caddyfile directive recognised by `config.go`, every JSON-only field on the `Middleware` struct, the precise Phase 1 evaluation order, and the parser- vs. `Provision`-time defaults.
- `docs/rules.md` documents the JSON tag mismatch on `Rule.Action` (struct tag is `mode`, while the bundled rule files commonly use `action`), so authors know which key is actually parsed.
- `docs/ratelimit.md` corrects the `match_all_paths` semantics to match `ratelimiter.go` (`true` ⇒ rate-limit every request; `false` + non-empty `paths` ⇒ rate-limit only matching paths).
- `docs/dynamicupdates.md` adds an explicit reload matrix showing which settings are reloaded by `fsnotify` and which require `caddy reload`.
- `docs/metrics.md` documents the actual response schema returned by `handleMetricsRequest` and clarifies that all counters are process-local and reset on restart.
- `docs/prometheus.md` switches the example exporter from `Counter.inc(absolute)` to `Gauge.set(absolute)` to match the WAF's monotonic process-local counter semantics.
- `caddyfile.example` no longer references non-existent directives (`country_block`, `custom_response { … }` block form).
- Removed emoji from all user-facing documentation.

### Changed
- Bumped version constant `wafVersion` to `v0.3.1`.

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- Resolved duplicate response headers when a custom block response was emitted.
- IP blacklist loader now accepts CIDR notation in addition to single IPs (`net.ParseCIDR` is tried before `net.ParseIP`).

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed
- Fixed potential panic in `isIPBlacklisted()` when parsing malformed IP addresses - now uses `netip.ParseAddr()` instead of `netip.MustParseAddr()`.
- Fixed type assertion panic in `processRuleMatch()` - now uses safe `getLogID()` helper function.
- Fixed potential panic in `extractIP()` and `getClientIP()` when handling empty or malformed input.

### Added
- Added 30-second HTTP client timeout in `tor.go` to prevent hanging requests during Tor exit node list fetches.
- Added comprehensive input validation in `Validate()` method for negative threshold/limit values.
- Added parameter validation in `NewRateLimiter()` to ensure positive values.

### Changed
- Updated installation documentation to clarify that `caddy add-package` is not available (module not registered in Caddy's package registry).
- Reordered installation methods in documentation to recommend Quick Script and xcaddy as primary options.
- Updated `CADDY_MODULE_REGISTRATION.md` with current registration status.

### Documentation
- Added warnings about `caddy add-package` limitations in README.md, installation.md, and add-package-guide.md.
